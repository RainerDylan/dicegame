## **Rules:**
- Each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they wish.
- If neither die rolls a 1, the sum of both dice is added to the player's round score.
- If a 1 appears on either die, the player loses their round score and their turn ends immediately.
- Players can choose to Hold, transferring their round score to their global score and ending their turn.
- The first player to reach the set winning score (default: 100) wins the game.

## **How to Play**

1. Click the Roll Dice button to roll two dice.
2. If you roll a 1, your turn ends and you lose your round score.
3. If you roll any other number, it adds to your round score.
4. Click Hold to save your round score to your global score and switch turns.
5. The first player to reach the winning score wins!
